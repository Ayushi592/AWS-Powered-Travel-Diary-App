# AWS-Powered-Travel-Diary-App

A cloud-powered web app to store and share travel memories securely.

## Overview

Travel Diary App is a secure and scalable web application built using AWS Amplify.
It allows users to:
✅ Create an account & log in securely
✅ Upload and store travel photos & notes
✅ View their personal travel memories anytime
✅ Store content securely in the cloud

This project demonstrates full-stack cloud development using serverless architecture.

## Features
## Feature	Description
🔐 User Authentication	Login & Signup using AWS Cognito
🗂 Secure File Uploads	Store images safely using AWS S3
🌍 Diary Entries	Add travel notes & memories
